This repository contains codes for ML intern tasks at Cognorise Infotech

Task: HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION
• Algorithm: Linear Regression,random forest regression ,decision tree regression,
gradient boosting regressor
• Description: Predict house prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms,
and location.
Task: SPAM EMAIL DETECTION
● Algorithm: Logistic Regression,random forest classifier, adaboosting classifier, knn
● Description: Create a model to classify emails as spam or not spam based on their
content.
Task: DIGIT RECOGNIZER
● Build a digit recognition model using the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28
pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).
● Train a neural network (e.g., a simple feedforward network or a convolutional neural
network) to classify the images into their respective digits.
